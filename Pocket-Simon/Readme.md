## PCB Design
If you wish to make your build more permanent, I have provided a PCB version that is the about the size of a credit card (70mm x 45mm). In addition, the PCB utilizes two slide switches SW5 and SW6. Switch SW5 is used to power on and off the game while switch SW6 "mutes" the piezo/buzzer speaker as to not disturb anyone.
