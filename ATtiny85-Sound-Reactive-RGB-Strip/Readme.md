# ATtiny85 Sound Reactive RGB Strip
#### Create an RGB strip that reacts to sound (i.e. music) 
#### Features
+ LDR to ensure that the RGB strip operates only in a dark environment.
## Component List
+ Attiny85
+ RGB Strip (preferably 5V)
+ Breadboard 
+ 1 Sound sensor
+ 1 470 ohm resistor
+ 1 Photoresistor
+ Attiny85 Programmer or Arduino Uno
+ 10uF Capacitor (if not using a programmer)
## Wiring
Below show how to wire up the components via a schematic and physically on a breadboard.

## Code & Uploading to Attiny85
The sketch can be uploaded either using an attiny85 programmer or using an Arduino UNO. If you are unfamiliar with programming the Attiny85 with an Arduino UNO, I recommend following this [tutorial](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arjun/programming-attiny85-with-arduino-uno-afb829).
